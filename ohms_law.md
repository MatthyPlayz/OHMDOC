# Ohm's Law
## What is Ohm's Law?
Ohm's Law is as follows:
<!-- https://latex.codecogs.com/ -->
![I=V/R](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?I=\frac{V}{R})
![V=IR](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?V=IR)
![R=V/I](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?R=\frac{V}{I})
where:
![I=current](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?I=current)
![V=voltage](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?V=voltage)
![R=resistance](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?R=resistance)
### Why is Ohm's Law important?
Ohm's Law is important because this means that current, voltage, and resistance are quite dependent on each other and each effect each other
as each changes.
It also is a very helpful equation for calculating current, voltage, and resistance. For example, calculating current from this simple circuit:
![4.7 kOhm resistor connected to +5V](https://i.ibb.co/ts0PQ4R/circuit-1.png)
To solve this, use the formula:
![I=V/R](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?I=\frac{V}{R})
![I=5/4700](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?I=\frac{5}{4.7})

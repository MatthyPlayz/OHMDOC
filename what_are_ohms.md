# What are Ohms? (Full)
Ohms are a unit of measurement in electricity to measure resistance of electrical energy.
## Ohm's Law
### What is Ohm's Law?
Ohm's Law is as follows:
<!-- https://latex.codecogs.com/ -->
![I=V/R](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?I=\frac{V}{R})
![V=IR](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?V=IR)
![R=V/I](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?R=\frac{V}{I})
where:
![I=current](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?I=current)
![V=voltage](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?V=voltage)
![R=resistance](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?R=resistance)
#### Why is Ohm's Law important?
Ohm's Law is important because this means that current, voltage, and resistance are quite dependent on each other and each effect each other
as each changes.
It also is a very helpful equation for calculating current, voltage, and resistance. For example, calculating current from this simple circuit:
![4.7 kOhm resistor connected to +5V](https://i.ibb.co/ts0PQ4R/circuit-1.png)
To solve this, use the formula:
![I=V/R](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?I=\frac{V}{R})
![I=5/4700](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?I=\frac{5}{4.7})

## What is a voltage divider?
A voltage divider is a simple circuit used to lower the voltage of higher-voltage circuits via a pair of resistors.
Consider this circuit, this is a voltage divider:
![Two resistors connected to positive and negative with an output in between the two resistors](https://i.ibb.co/ckFJPyQ/circuit-2.png)
### Calculating the output of a Voltage Divider
Using the example below, we will now calculate the output of the voltage divider:
![Two resistors connected to positive and negative with an output in between the two resistors](https://i.ibb.co/ckFJPyQ/circuit-2.png)
Using this format:
![Vout = (Vs*R2)/(R1+R2)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?V_{out}=\frac{V_s\times%20R_2}{(R_1%20+%20R_2)})
where:
Vout = output voltage
Vs = source voltage
R1 = 1st resistor ohms
R2 = 2nd resistor ohms
Using that, we can plug our amounts in:
![Vout = (5*1000)/(1000+1000)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?V_{out}=\frac{5\times%201000}{(1000%20+%201000)})
![Vout = 5000/2000](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?V_{out}=\frac{5000}{(2000)})
![Vout = 5/2](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?V_{out}=\frac{5}{2})
![= 2.5](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?=2.5)
